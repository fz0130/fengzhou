Welcome to my website! I am an assistant professor of finance at Toulouse Business School in France. I received my PhD from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, master from Washington University in St.Louis, and bachelor from HKUST.

My main research interest include sustainable finance and political economy of finance. I am also keen on photography with both digital and film cameras, as well as drones.
